# Blog platform smart contract

This smart contract represents the logic of the decentralized
blogging platform on NEAR Discovery.

It keeps track of authors, moderators, blog posts and a denylist
of account IDs not allowed to write or moderate.

The content of the blog posts (as well as the thumbnail of the
blog posts) is to be kept on ipfs and the CIDs are stored in the
contract.
